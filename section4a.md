# Section 4a: QGIS And The Spatial Database(PostGIS)

As mentioned in the first section,we are now at the point where we need to see these steps in action.We are done with the theory parts of the series. We would write codes,make mistakes and do all sorts of manipulations.Therefore most of the remaining sections of the series would be videos. I believe you would gain a lot from this.
This section is splitted into two parts. This part(Part A) would focus on the installation of QGIS and PostGIS while part B would be on working with the software. Installing these software are pretty straightforward as they have versions for major flavors of operating systems and a very clear and easy to follow documentation. If you have these software installed already,you could skip this section and proceed to the next one.

### QGIS Installation(Windows)

### QGIS Installation (Ubuntu 20.04 focal)
